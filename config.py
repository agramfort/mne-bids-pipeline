# FREQUENCY FILTERING
# -------------------
# done in 01-import_and_filter.py

# Good Practice / Advice
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# It is typically better to set your filtering properties on the raw data so
# as to avoid what we call border (or edge) effects.
#
# If you use this pipeline for evoked responses, you could consider
# a low-pass filter cut-off of h_freq = 40 Hz
# and possibly a high-pass filter cut-off of l_freq = 1 Hz
# so you would preserve only the power in the 1Hz to 40 Hz band.
# Note that highpass filtering is not necessarily recommended as it can
# distort waveforms of evoked components, or simply wash out any low
# frequency that can may contain brain signal. It can also act as
# a replacement for baseline correction in Epochs. See below.
#
# If you use this pipeline for time-frequency analysis, a default filtering
# could be a high-pass filter cut-off of l_freq = 1 Hz
# a low-pass filter cut-off of h_freq = 120 Hz
# so you would preserve only the power in the 1Hz to 120 Hz band.
#
# If you need more fancy analysis, you are already likely past this kind
# of tips! :)


# ``l_freq`` : float
#   The low-frequency cut-off in the highpass filtering step.
#   Keep it None if no highpass filtering should be applied.

l_freq = 1.

# ``h_freq`` : float
#   The high-frequency cut-off in the lowpass filtering step.
#   Keep it None if no lowpass filtering should be applied.

h_freq = 40.

###############################################################################
# MAXFILTER PARAMETERS
# --------------------
#
# ``use_maxwell_filter`` : bool
#   Use or not maxwell filter to preprocess the data.

use_maxwell_filter = True

# There are two kinds of maxfiltering: SSS and tSSS
# [SSS = signal space separation ; tSSS = temporal signal space separation]
# (Taulu et al, 2004): http://cds.cern.ch/record/709081/files/0401166.pdf
#
# ``mf_st_duration`` : float | None
#    If not None, apply spatiotemporal SSS (tSSS) with specified buffer
#    duration (in seconds). MaxFilterâ„¢'s default is 10.0 seconds in v2.2.
#    Spatiotemporal SSS acts as implicitly as a high-pass filter where the
#    cut-off frequency is 1/st_dur Hz. For this (and other) reasons, longer
#    buffers are generally better as long as your system can handle the
#    higher memory usage. To ensure that each window is processed
#    identically, choose a buffer length that divides evenly into your data.
#    Any data at the trailing edge that doesn't fit evenly into a whole
#    buffer window will be lumped into the previous buffer.
#
# Good Practice / Advice
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# If you are interested in low frequency activity (<0.1Hz), avoid using tSSS
# and set mf_st_duration to None
#
# If you are interested in low frequency above 0.1 Hz, you can use the
# default mf_st_duration to 10 s meaning it acts like a 0.1 Hz highpass filter.
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> mf_st_duration = None
# or
# >>> mf_st_duration = 10.  # to apply tSSS with 0.1Hz highpass filter.

mf_st_duration = None

# ``mf_head_origin`` : array-like, shape (3,) | 'auto'
#   Origin of internal and external multipolar moment space in meters.
#   If 'auto', it will be estimated from headshape points.
#   If automatic fitting fails (e.g., due to having too few digitization
#   points), consider separately calling the fitting function with different
#   options or specifying the origin manually.
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> mf_head_origin = 'auto'

mf_head_origin = 'auto'

# ``cross talk`` : str
#   Path to the cross talk file
#
#
# ``calibration`` : str
#   Path to the calibration file.
#
#
# These 2 files should be downloaded and made available for running
# maxwell filtering.
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> cal_files_path = os.path.join(study_path, 'SSS')
# >>> mf_ctc_fname = os.path.join(cal_files_path, 'ct_sparse_mgh.fif')
# >>> mf_cal_fname = os.path.join(cal_files_path, 'sss_cal_mgh.dat')
#
# Warning
# ~~~~~~~
# These 2 files are site and machine specific files that provide information
# about the environmental noise. For practical purposes, place them in your
# study folder.
#
# At NeuroSpin: ct_sparse and sss_call are on the meg_tmp server

cal_files_path = os.path.join(study_path, 'system_calibration_files')
mf_ctc_fname = os.path.join(cal_files_path, 'ct_sparse_nspn.fif')
mf_cal_fname = os.path.join(cal_files_path, 'sss_cal_nspn.dat')

# Despite all possible care to avoid movements in the MEG, the participant
# will likely slowly drift down from the Dewar or slightly shift the head
# around in the course of the recording session. Hence, to take this into
# account, we are realigning all data to a single position. For this, you need
# to define a reference run (typically the one in the middle of
# the recording session).
#
# ``mf_reference_run``  : int
#   Which run to take as the reference for adjusting the head position of all
#   runs.
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> mf_reference_run = 0  # to use the first run

mf_reference_run = 0

###############################################################################
# RESAMPLING
# ----------
#
# Good Practice / Advice
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# If you have acquired data with a very high sampling frequency (e.g. 2 kHz)
# you will likely want to downsample to lighten up the size of the files you
# are working with (pragmatics)
# If you are interested in typical analysis (up to 120 Hz) you can typically
# resample your data down to 500 Hz without preventing reliable time-frequency
# exploration of your data
#
# ``resample_sfreq``  : float
#   Specifies at which sampling frequency the data should be resampled.
#   If None then no resampling will be done.
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> resample_sfreq = None  # no resampling
# or
# >>> resample_sfreq = 500  # resample to 500Hz

resample_sfreq = 500.  # None

# ``decim`` : int
#   Says how much to decimate data at the epochs level.
#   It is typically an alternative to the `resample_sfreq` parameter that
#   can be used for resampling raw data. 1 means no decimation.
#
# Good Practice / Advice
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Decimation requires to lowpass filtered the data to avoid aliasing.
# Note that using decimation is much faster than resampling.
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> decim = 1  # no decimation
# or
# >>> decim = 4  # decimate by 4 ie devide sampling frequency by 4

decim = 1

###############################################################################
# AUTOMATIC REJECTION OF ARTIFACTS
# --------------------------------
#
# Good Practice / Advice
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Have a look at your raw data and train yourself to detect a blink, a heart
# beat and an eye movement.
# You can do a quick average of blink data and check what the amplitude looks
# like.
#
#  ``reject`` : dict | None
#    The rejection limits to make some epochs as bads.
#    This allows to remove strong transient artifacts.
#    If you want to reject and retrieve blinks later, e.g. with ICA,
#    don't specify a value for the eog channel (see examples below).
#    Make sure to include values for eeg if you have EEG data
#
# Note
# ~~~~
# These numbers tend to vary between subjects.. You might want to consider
# using the autoreject method by Jas et al. 2018.
# See https://autoreject.github.io
#
# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> reject = {'grad': 4000e-13, 'mag': 4e-12, 'eog': 150e-6}
# >>> reject = {'grad': 4000e-13, 'mag': 4e-12, 'eeg': 200e-6}

# ``trigger_time_shift`` : float | None
#    If float it specifies the offset for the trigger and the stimulus

# Example
# ~~~~~~~
# >>> trigger_time_shift = 0  # don't apply any offset

trigger_time_shift = -0.0416

# ``baseline`` : tuple
#    It specifies how to baseline the epochs; if None, no baseline is applied.
#
# Example

# to take a baseline before that

# or
# >>> event_id = {'Onset': 4} with conditions = ['Onset']
